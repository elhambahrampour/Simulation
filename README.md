# Simulation

In this study, we assume that the reader is familiar with the technical precision medicine terms such as "treatment" and "treatment-free" models, confounding, adjusting for a confounder, model specification, etc.

In this causal inference project, we conduct a simulation study to explore the doubly-robustness of the dWOLS estimators. 
In the second part, we investigate the impact of a violation of No Unmeasured Confounding (NUC) assumption on these estimators.

## Study Case

To investigate whether the the dWOLS estimators are doubly-robust and how violation of the NUC assumption affects the estimators.

##  Goal

To explore the  doubly-robustness of the dWOLS estimators.

## Challenging

Obtaining the optimal terms in model specifications are not realistic thus we remove the terms from model specifications and assess how the estimators behave.
The sample size could result the bias-ness, so we chose two big different sample sizes and investigated the pattern of the results. 


## What else I might do

I like to conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess how the bias in estimators can vary in a range of a sensitivity parameter.
